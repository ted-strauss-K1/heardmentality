  <div class="innn"><p>Heard Mentality is an open and unbiased forum for global opinion for history’s and today’s most
    debated issues.</p>

    <p>Heard Mentality sees the internet and the limitless possibilities it presents as the most powerful tool for
      strengthening the globally important societal virtues of liberty, equality and freedom. People from around the
      world can now share ideas and experiences like never before in history – creating opportunities never thought
      before possible.</p>

    <p>Heard Mentality strives to fill the role in this new world of interconnectedness and communication as the
      impartial meeting place on the internet where information and public opinion on important issues can be shared in
      an open and structured forum.</p>

    <p>We recognize that real value is generated by the integrity of our user community and the site – developing
      policies and mechanisms that promote the creation of user driven knowledge and opinion base while still protecting

      <div class="innn"><p>Its free to participate in the Resources section.</p></div>
      <div class="innn"><h6>Why do we do this?</h6>

        <p>The more agrees a debate or resource post has; the more attention it will get. Similar to how you can only
          vote once on each issue and have a representative affect on its results. By limiting Agrees and Disagrees, we
          hope you will be more selective about how you use them.</p>

        <p>Everybody has an opinion on everything and sometimes finding concise arguments is like finding a needle in a
          haystack or a grade 3 class where the teacher has lost control. We want you to be selective on where you voice
          your opinions in Heard Mentality. We also made it cheaper to agree with what some else already said reducing
          the clutter that sometimes accumulates in web forums.</p></div>

  </div>
  <div id="pundits"><h3 class="din">3.2 Pundits</h3>

    <div class="innn"><p>Only those users who have been very influential in the debate and on the site will become
      Pundits. You first become a pundit in one of the sub sections by having other users agree with your debate on the
      questions within that sections. Being in the top 4 Pundits positions of a section or sub section earns you the
      right to have unlimited agree, disagree and posting within that section. As your postings become recognized in
      other sub sections, you may rise to being a pundit of a section and ultimately for the entire site.</p></div>

    </div>
    <h6>Principles:</h6>

    <p><span class="highlighted">Concise:</span> Take pity on the reader – information should be presented in a non
      verbose manner. Pride should be taken from wording things concisely. This will ensure users can consume and retain
      a larger amount of information as well as making technical features like the translations and search more
      effective. Studies also show that more people will stop to read a shorter comment and more likely to pass over
      longer ones.</p>

    <p><span class="highlighted">Clean:</span> No profanity please. Consider all users when choosing your language.
      People take the posting more seriously when it refrains from using harsh and negative words. Also, abbreviations
      should be avoided as other users or the translation feature may not understand.</p>

    <p><span class="highlighted">Original:</span> Pleased do not repeat anything that has been already posted. Any
      duplicate content dilutes the overall accuracy of the compiled information. Any new issue or posting added to
      Heard Mentality should be significantly different than existing content. Good practice would be to “agree” with
      the posting you may want to reiterate or voting on the issue that already exists - this will ultimately draw more
      attention to it.</p>

    <p><span class="highlighted">Golden Rule:</span> This is the fundamental rule to make any social community work.
      Please treat others like you would like to be treated yourself and you in return will get the same.</p>

    <p><span class="highlighted">Important:</span> Issues should be classifiable into the provided high level sections.
      Please do not post issues that could be considered unimportant, for example: The hairdo of a certain celebrity or
      which restaurant or movie is best. While these may be important questions, these are not the types of issues to be
      discussed here.

    <p></p><span class="highlighted">Unbiased:</span> Issues should be posted in an unbiased and non-leading way. Issues
    should be posed simply and direct. All realistic possible answers should be introduced.</p><p><span
      class="highlighted">On Point:</span> When creating or replying to a debate, please discuss only the issue at hand
      and reframe from any outside discussions. The Heard Mentality debate works differently than others web forums. We
      ask you to post meaningful insight or references on the issue and refrain from exchanging pleasantries (this can
      be done through other communication channels). Recognition of one’s point well made or a good reply to one’s post
      is encouraged by "agreeing".</p>

    <p><span class="highlighted">Truthful:</span> Never post any false information. Strive to post only what can be
      backed up by facts. References and links should always be provided when available.</p>

    <p><span class="highlighted">Considerate:</span> Discussions within the debate are about issues and questions
      surrounding those issues. Postings should never be directed to other users directly, nor should they treat any
      other user disrespectfully. Please keep personal emotion out of discussion and consider each person’s right to
      their own view.</p></div>
