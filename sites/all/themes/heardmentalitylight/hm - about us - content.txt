<h2 id="what_is_hm" class="din">1. What Heard Mentality is about</h2>

    <div class="innn"><p>Heard Mentality is an open and unbiased forum for global opinion on history’s and
        today’s most debated issues.
    </p>

        <p>Heard Mentality sees the internet and the possibilities it presents as a powerful tool
            for strengthening the globally important values of liberty, equality and freedom.
            People from around the world can now share ideas and experiences like never
            before, creating new opportunities for understanding the diverse and complex
            issues that affect how we live.
        </p>

        <p>In this new world of interconnectedness and global communication, Heard Mentality
            strives to act as an impartial meeting place where information and public opinion on
            important issues can be shared in an open and structured forum.</p>

        <p>Heard Mentality will help bring the global community closer - allowing people from
            all over the world to communicate openly on important issues. We’re accustomed
            to having our understanding of issues mediated by news conglomerates and
            corporations; Heard Mentality allows users to go straight to the source, to see how
            users voted on issues and learn from those who are directly affected by them.</p>

        <p>We recognize that real value is generated by the integrity of our user community
            and the site, and we are committed to developing policies and mechanisms that
            promote the creation of user-driven knowledge and opinion base while still
            protecting the individual users’ rights to <a href="/privacy">privacy</a></p>

        <div class="innn">

            <p>Heard Mentality is the first website in the world to break down the language barrier
                - facilitating global understanding. All content entered into Heard Mentality by our
                users is translated into the world’s major languages using the Microsoft Translator
                API. Anyone with experience with today’s automated translations technology knows
                that translation results are far from perfect – however we feel the compromise of
                accuracy in translations is overshadowed by the communication potential.
            </p>

            <p>Please help us improve our translations on this site by flagging inaccurate or
                imprecise translations and providing for us the accurate translations.

    <div class="innn">
        <p>Users should take great pride in following these guidelines and principles, as a more
            vibrant social and information network will result. The guidelines and principles
            have been developed to promote:
        </p>
        <ul>

        <?php print theme('flagger_flags'); ?>


        <p><span class="highlighted">Concise:</span> Present information as clearly and concisely as possible. Avoid
            jargon and
            language that can’t be understood by most people. This will help other users to
            engage with your comments more easily, and will also make technical features like
            the translations and searches more effective.
        </p>

        <p><span class="highlighted">Clean:</span> No profanity please. Consider all users when choosing your words.
            People
            will take a posting more seriously when it refrains from using harsh and negative
            words. Abbreviations and acronyms should also be avoided, as other users or the
            translation feature may not understand what you mean.</p>

        <p><span class="highlighted">Original:</span> Pleased do not repeat anything that has been already posted. Any
            duplicate content dilutes the overall accuracy of the compiled information. Any new
            issue or posting added to Heard Mentality should be significantly different from
            existing content. A good practice is to “agree” with a posting you feel strongly
            about or to vote on an issue that already exists - this will ultimately draw more
            attention to it.</p>

        <p><span class="highlighted">Golden Rule:</span> This is the fundamental practice that makes any social
            community
            work. Please treat others as you would like to be treated yourself, and you in return
            will get the same.
        </p>

        <p><span class="highlighted">Important:</span> Issues should be classifiable into the available topics. While
            conversations on celebrity gossip, the latest fashion trend or sporting rivalries may
            be stimulating, there are many other forums on the internet to discuss these issues.
            Heard Mentality is a space for voicing your opinion on social, economic, and political
            issues that affect us on a global scale.
        </p>

        <p><span class="highlighted">Unbiased:</span> Issues should be posted in an unbiased and non-leading way. The
            tone
            should be simple and direct. Consider, when posting an issue, that people from
            around the world will be reading and engaging with it, and try to create an
            atmosphere of open conversation.</p>

        <p><span class="highlighted">On Point:</span> When creating or replying to an argument, please discuss only the
            issue
            at hand and refrain from any outside conversations. The Heard Mentality platform
            works differently from other web forums; we ask you to post meaningful insight or
            references on the issue and refrain from exchanging pleasantries. Recognition of a
            well-made point or a good reply to a post is encouraged by “agreeing”.</p>

        <p><span class="highlighted">Truthful:</span> Never post any false information. Strive to post only what can be
            backed
            up by facts. References and links should always be provided when available.</p>

        <p><span class="highlighted">Considerate:</span> The heart of Heard Mentality is the issues and opinions
            generated by
            its users. While it’s normal to feel passionate about a particular issue, it’s important
            that the discussion remain impersonal and focused on the issue. Please refrain
            from personally attacking another user or treating them disrespectfully. You may
            encounter opinions very different from your own, and while you have every right to
            dispute or disagree, please make your argument about the issue, not the person
            discussing it.
